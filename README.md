# Reasons I Quit

## TL;DR
In case you want to share with your colleagues the reasons why you decided to quit, just add the number for the reason(s) at the end of your farewell message.

## Longer version
I was always super curious about the reasons why someone decided to quit the company were we are working. In the final messages most of the people try to not burn bridges and keep things nice. Sometimes you can read more in what is not written, often the only way is to jump on Linkedin and try to connect to that person, maybe have a chat and let them air what was bothering them.

I have also quit a few places in the past and I wanted to share what was happening and way. Of course I did with the people close to me, but there were always a few other curious and too shy to ping me. I am one of these introvert people who likes to talk a lot about things, just try me :)

These are the main reasons why I thouhgt about `reasons-I-quit`. I hope this can be useful to someone else other then me.

# How to use

From the reasons.md file, pick the reasons that are relevant to you and add the numbers at the end of your good by message (or share the numbers directly with your favorite colleagues).

Example:

> Dear all,
>
>As you probably know, today is my last day at The Best Company In The World (TM).
>
>I want to thank everybody for the last 3 years of adventures, laughs and happyness. A special thank goes to Bort, my manager, who endlessy supported me, and Karen, who made easier my 2 and half hours commute. 
>
>I wish you all the best and success for the future.
>
>Best
>Michael
>
>If you want to keep contact my mail is michael@whatever and my ICQ number is 5 19 7


The people in the know can check the reasons file and discover that Michael was:

```
... 
5 Found a better job that pays more.
...
7 I quit my manager.
...
19 They offered me a severance package if I would leave.

```
